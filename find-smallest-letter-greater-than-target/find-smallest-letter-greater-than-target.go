# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The code aims to find the next greatest letter in a given sorted array of letters, letters, compared to a target letter, target.
# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Iterate through each letter in the letters array using a for range loop.
Check if the current letter is greater than the target letter.
2. If a letter greater than the target is found, return that letter as the next greatest letter.
3. If no letter greater than the target is found in the letters array, return the first letter of the array as the next greatest letter since it is a circular search.
4. If the letters array is empty, return an appropriate value (such as 0 or an empty byte) as the next greatest letter.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:The code has a time complexity of O(n) because it iterates through each letter in the letters array once.
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity:The code has a space complexity of O(1) since it doesn't use any extra space that scales with the input size.
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
package main

import "fmt"

func nextGreatestLetter(letters []byte, target byte) byte {
    for _, letter := range letters {
        if letter > target {
            return letter
        }
    }
    return letters[0]
}
```
