# Zigzag Conversion Solution in Go (Golang)

## Intuition
I initially thought of solving this problem by iterating through the given string and placing each character in the appropriate row of the zigzag pattern.

## Approach
To solve the problem, I used the following approach:
- First, I checked for special cases where the number of rows is 1 or greater than or equal to the length of the input string. In such cases, I returned the input string as it is.
- I created a slice of strings called `rows` to represent each row in the zigzag pattern.
- I used a `currentRow` variable to keep track of the current row I'm filling.
- I used a boolean variable `goingDown` to determine whether I should move down or up in the zigzag pattern.
- I iterated through each character in the input string and added it to the appropriate row in the `rows` slice based on the currentRow value and the `goingDown` flag.
- Whenever the currentRow reached the topmost or bottommost row, I toggled the `goingDown` flag to change direction.
- Finally, I joined all the rows together to form the converted string using `strings.Join()`.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
- Space complexity: O(n) because the `rows` slice can have at most n elements (when numRows is equal to the length of the string).

## Code
```go
func convert(s string, numRows int) string {
	if numRows == 1 || numRows >= len(s) {
		return s
	}

	rows := make([]string, numRows)
	currentRow := 0
	goingDown := false

	for _, char := range s {
		rows[currentRow] += string(char)
		if currentRow == 0 || currentRow == numRows-1 {
			goingDown = !goingDown
		}
		if goingDown {
			currentRow++
		} else {
			currentRow--
		}
	}
	return strings.Join(rows, "")
}
